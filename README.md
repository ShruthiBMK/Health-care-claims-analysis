# Health-care-claims-analysis
U.S. healthcare claims analysis project using SQL and Power BI to analyze claim volume, costs, approval rates, payer performance (Medicare, Medicaid etc.), and cost drivers through an executive-ready dashboard.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world U.S. healthcare claims analysis for an insurance payer. The objective is to analyze medical claims data to uncover trends in claim volume, costs, approvals, payer performance, and cost drivers, and to present insights through an executive-ready Power BI dashboard.

### Business Objectives

- Monitor overall claims volume and total claim cost.

- Analyze claim approval vs denial patterns.

- Compare performance across insurance payers (Aetna,Cigna, Medicare, Medicaid).

- Identify high-cost diagnoses and providers.

- Enable time-based trend analysis using a Date dimension.

### Dataset Description

The dataset represents anonymized healthcare claims data and includes:

- Patients: demographics and geography (state)

- Claims: claim amounts, covered amounts, claim status, service dates

 - Insurance Plans: payer type (UHC, Medicare, Medicaid)

 - Diagnoses: diagnosis codes and descriptions

 - Providers: provider-level claim activity

⚠️ Note: This is a simulated dataset created for learning and portfolio purposes.

### Tools & Technologies
